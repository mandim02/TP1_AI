In the current scenario of energy crisis, it is intended to reschedule the schedules of classes of the
undergraduate courses of the school of technology in order to reduce travel to campus and to
lower the need for air conditioning.
Consider that all lessons, with a duration of 2 hours, take place on weekdays. All classes have 10
lessons per week, of which 1 or 2 lessons are online. A class should not have more than 3 lessons
per day. Online lessons cannot be booked immediately or immediately after a face-to-face
lesson. Only up to 2 lessons can take place in the morning and up to 2 lessons in the afternoon.
Every class has 2 to 4 lessons in a specific classroom.
You must formulate and implement an agent that finds the best solution for class schedules,
minimizing the number of days each class must travel to campus and the number of classrooms
used. Solutions that have schedules with fewer holes should be valued. Other constraints should
be added to make this problem more realistic.
